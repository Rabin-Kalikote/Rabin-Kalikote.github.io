                        Hello everybody! I'm Rabin. I was born on May 2, 2001 AD. I'm from Syabun, Sankhuwasabha that is a beautiful village of Nepal. During my childhood I was in the same place playing and enjoying with the nature of my beautiful Village. I used to go school with my sister there. I was studying in grade two. Then we decided to be in Khandbari for our study. I wasn't willing to leave my village but also I had to. Lastly we came to khandbari.<br>
                        I didn't know what we would be doing there. I was admitted in Surya Sec Boarding School. I didn't know why I was there but when I studied there for some years I realized that what I can do. I continiously learn in the same school. Now I a'm the student of grade Nine of Surya Secondary Boarding School. During my some year of learing, I have learned many things in the diverse subjects. Among them arts, science and computer are my favourites.<br>
                        Though I left my beautiful village, I a'm not so sad because I got many things being in Khandbari. I was able to write a story book expressed all by poems (Jindagiko Baato) that is my own creation. I have learned a lot about scientifical experiences and facts. In the other side computer programming is equally exciting. So, I'm much excited with my student life.
